Hello Mr. Dinesh. I’m calling from my vintage property office regarding a property currently under construction. The expected completion is by December, around six months to one year from now. The property is a 500-meter tall building with a 2-feet elevation and comes with essential features like a power backup. You mentioned interest in a plot – we do have available plots in our layout. Have you heard of Kalpakkam? Even if you're not familiar with it, the location we’re offering is part of a pre-planned development zone with natural surroundings. It might take a little time to appreciate its value, but it’s a promising investment. We’re offering a 2400 square feet DTCP-approved plot for ₹33 lakhs, located near ECR 16 Road. It’s a well-connected area and a good opportunity for future growth. I’ll follow up with you shortly to discuss further. Thank you.

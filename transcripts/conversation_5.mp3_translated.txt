Oh, Arvind sir, hello. Yes, I’m Lakshmi from Vintage Property Shop. I called about the property for sale. Sir, our property is near Kuvathur—a plot, ground area 2400 square feet, priced at 33 lakhs. Do you know Kuvathur? We usually go to Kuvathur alone. Oh no, we haven’t seen much there, but it’s still a property worth checking out. Do you know the road? It’s a small construction. No, from there, our site is about 1.5 km away. Oh, but that’s a bit far. You mentioned Kuvathur? Yes, it’s called Kalpapati. You might face a little trouble getting it at this price, because the plot costs 33 lakhs per ground. The property has DTCP approval. It’s a total of 9 acres with 124 plots. No, no, no—why do you say that? Yes, there is some distance, but it’s not too far, just a bit off the main area. It’s not a deal-breaker. You’ll get good profit for less investment. From the 6-lane road, our site is just 1.5 km away. Within 5 years, the value is expected to double because there’s a government project about 15 km away—a football ground is being constructed. Football ground? Yes, sir. Okay, that will come, and then the 6-lane road will be accessible easily. The bus will take you directly from the bus stop and return without trouble. So if you consider our site, it’s just 1.5 km away. No, sir, I understand. I’m a businessman, so I know it’s not easy to manage. Okay, it’s not a gated community, but that’s not a problem for us. You’ll see there’s a sale level at 850 meters. There are full promoters on that side, and sales are going on in ECR. They’re planning to make it the next OMR. Okay, so prices will double eventually, it will take some time. Okay, I’ll send you the details on WhatsApp. Yes, I’ll send the details. You’ll get a better idea if you visit and see it. Okay.

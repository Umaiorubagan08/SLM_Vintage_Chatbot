Shankar sir, yes, I am Lakshmi from Vintage Property Shop. We have a property in ECR, and I called you about it. This property is in ECR, and the ground floor is 2400 sq.ft. It is DTCP approved and RERA certified. Our property is near Puvattur. Do you know Puvattur? Yes, I know, but I don't have much idea about buying there. Tell me the rate. It is 33 lakhs per ground floor. You can buy it even if it is off-site. What? One ground floor is 33 lakhs, sir. Okay, I will tell you more. We are selling only one ground floor. This is near Kuvattur, close to the Kuvattur police station, about 5 minutes travel by two-wheeler. This is our site in ECR, where they are constructing a 6-lane road. Do you know about that? Yes, the 6-lane road from Chennai to Kanyakumari. How far is the ECR road from there? Do you know Kalpakkam? Yes. From Kalpakkam to Kuvattur is about 8 km. Okay, Kuvattur is the timeâ€¦ Is the Chennai-Pondicherry highway nearby? Yes. How far is the ECR road from there? From ECR road to Kanyakumari, it is about 40-50 km. Oh, it is that way, about 40 km. So, the ECR road is not coming through that belt? No, it is ECR; it comes beyond Kalpakkam. It will reach ECR if you go left and go inside Kalpakkam. I have the ECR road from Chennai to Pondicherry. I am asking if it is along that line. Now, they are connecting the 6-lane road and the ECR road. From that line, if you see from our side, it will come within 1.5 km. Okay, okay, I understand. I am standing there and following the trend circle. Now, the property is 2400 sq.ft at 33 lakhs. It is state-approved by DTCP. There are a total of 124 plots covering 9 acres of land. Thirty amenities are planned, and a resort will be constructed on 10 grounds. Within 5 years, this will double in value. The Chennai to Kanyakumari 6-lane road is just 1.5 km from our site. Also, the sea is 850 meters away from the property. Okay, I will check it out. This is your WhatsApp number; I will send you the details. If you come to the site, you will get a better idea. This is a good investment, and within 5 years, the amount is expected to double. Okay?
